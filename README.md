## Overview of the Project

## Project: Quiz Game

### Objective
The objective of the quiz game project in C is to create an interactive console-based application that tests users general knowledge through a series of questions. Players will answer multiple-choice questions and earn points for each correct answer, enhancing their learning experience while improving their programming skills in C.

### Key Activities
- **Design the Game Structure**: Outline the main components, including the main menu, gameplay, and score display functions.
- **Implement Question Management**: Create a system to store and manage quiz questions, including random selection for each game session.
- **Develop User Interaction**: Build a console interface that allows users to start the game, view high scores, and access help instructions.
- **Handle Scoring and Feedback**: Implement logic to calculate scores based on correct answers and provide immediate feedback to the player.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the game functions correctly and fix any identified bugs.

### Technologies used
- **C Programming Language**: The entire project is developed using C, leveraging its capabilities for system-level programming.
- **Control Structures**: Use of loops, conditional statements, and functions to manage game flow and user interactions.
- **File Handling**: To store high scores and player data, allowing for persistent storage across game sessions.
